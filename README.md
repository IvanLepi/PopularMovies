# PopMovies
## Lightweight Movie App that allows users to discover top and popular movies playing.


*Based on Udacity course assignment.*

- Upon launch, present the user with an grid arrangement of movie posters.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
  - The sort order can be by most popular, or by top rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  - original title
  - movie poster image thumbnail
  - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  - release date
  - Ability to watch trailer

### TODO:
- [ ] Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- [ ] Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
- [ ] Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
- [ ] Document
